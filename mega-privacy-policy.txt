Welcome to the Mega app for android.
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
Pemissions the app requires:

    1. android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: This permission allows an app to write to external storage. It is used when an app needs to save data or files to the deviceâ€™s external storage.
    2. android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: This permission allows an app to access information about networks. It is used when an app needs to check the state of network connectivity, such as whether the device is connected to a network or not.
    3. android.permission.INTERNET: This permission allows an app to open network sockets and use the internet. It is used when an app needs to connect to the internet to send or receive data.
    
If you installed this application from Google Play, then Google Play does collect some personal data. Please see the privacy policy for Google Play Services here: https://policies.google.com/privacy

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
